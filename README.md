# MSCS532_Project_2

This repository contains the implementation for MSCS532 Project 2, which focuses on the partial implementation of the FM-Index data structure. The FM-Index is a compressed full-text searchable index that enables efficient pattern matching within large datasets. This project demonstrates key techniques such as the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), suffix arrays, rank arrays, and cumulative frequency tables (C-table) to facilitate fast text searches while maintaining memory efficiency.
